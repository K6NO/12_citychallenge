      "why" : "Here are some examples, but you are encouraged to do whatever comes into your mind: returning someone’s shopping trolley, buying someone a gift, giving a homeless person food vouchers, or food, not charging a client for work, paying for a stranger’s bus/train pass, helping someone else in need.",
      "difficulties" : "Random acts of kindness might born suspicion at first. Did the stranger offering me the coffee has second thoughts? Is it poisoned? Why does he/she do it? people have become individualistic over the last few decades, and score about 40% lower on tests of empathy than those brought up in the 1970s. Today we are not used to receiving unexpected acts of goodwill, so be patient with others and explain your intentions openly. ",
      "science": "Researchers from all over the world have found  that people who spend a bigger proportion of their income on others tend to be far happier, in the long run, than those spending it on themselves. (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-005-3650-z). Even if you may not get an immediate payback in terms of money or kindness, on the long run you are likely to feel more satisfied. Michael Norton from Harvard Business School has tested the concept with data from more than 130 countries, from the US to Uganda. “Across all countries – rich or poor, and in every continent – people who gave more tended to be happier people,” he says. For this reason, he thinks the joy of giving appears to be a “psychological universal” – a trait that lies at the core of human nature, independent of your culture. Giving to others can increase your social connection (who isn’t grateful after they’ve received a nice present) and your sense of purpose in life; you feel like you’ve made a difference, and there is a point in getting out of bed in the morning.",

      "description": "Pare down your wardrobe to 33 items that you wear in the next month. You can expect to have more money, time, space, clarity and freedom in your life. You will spend less on things you don’t really need, will have plenty of physical space in your home and reserve your mental energies for more important thoughts. Last, but not least, your mornings will start with a simple, happy choice among your favourite pieces.",
      "why" : "<a href='https://bemorewithless.com/project-333/'>Rules come from the owner of the idea.</a> Max. 33 items including clothing, accessories, jewelry, outerwear and shoes. These items are not counted as part of the 33 items – wedding ring or another sentimental piece of jewelry that you never take off, underwear, sleep wear, in-home lounge wear,  and workout clothing (you can only wear your workout clothing to workout). How to do it: Choose your 33 items, box up the remainder of your fashion statement, seal it with tape and put it out of sight. What else: consider that you are creating a wardrobe that you can live, work and play in for three months. Remember that this is not a project in suffering. If your clothes don’t fit or are in poor condition, replace them.",
      "difficulties" : "You will have to jump a number of mental fences. First, the 333 challenge needs planning. Take your and do you your prep. You will regain that multiple times during the next month. Remember, this is not about suffering, but about joy and freedom and good preparation is key to achieve these results. Second, you may think that others will judge you for wearing the same clothes repeatedly. Most people having done this challenge for much longer periods report that they peers at work, school or public spaces don’t notice any difference. When the topic comes up they usually receive very positive feedback from others. ",
